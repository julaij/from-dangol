# JavaScript Code Fencing
This is a JavaScript program that gets the first key that satisfies the following testing function. Otherwise it 
returns undefined.Use Object.keys(obj) to get all the properties of the object, Array.prototype.find() to test
each key-value pair using fn.The callback receives three arguments - the value, the key and the object.

```javascript
    const findKey = (obj, fn) => Object.keys(obj).find(key => fn(obj[key], key, obj));

    console.log(findKey(
    {
        barney: { age: 36, active: true },
        fred: { age: 40, active: false },
        pebbles: { age: 1, active: true }
    },
    o => o['active']
    ));
```
